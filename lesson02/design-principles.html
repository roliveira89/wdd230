            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <p><strong>Hick's Law</strong> suggests that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number of choices available.</p>
            <h2>Example: Airbnb</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Visit Airbnb</a></p>
            <h2>Mobile View Screenshot</h2>
            <img src="images/airbnb.jpeg" alt="Airbnb Screenshot">
            <p>Airbnb is a popular online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals.</p>
            <p>In the mobile view of Airbnb's website, Hick's Law is exemplified by the streamlined and intuitive booking process. The initial focus on a single search bar minimizes distractions and choices, guiding users to input their destination. As users proceed, options are presented step by step, gradually revealing more choices like check-in/out dates and the number of guests. This gradual presentation of choices reduces cognitive load, making the decision-making process manageable and aligning with Hick's Law. Airbnb optimizes the user experience and facilitates quicker decision-making through this approach.</p>

            <h2>PARC: Proximity</h2>
            <p><strong>PARC: Proximity</strong> is a design principle that suggests related elements should be placed close to each other, while unrelated elements should have more space between them.</p>
            <p>Example: Amazon Product Listing</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Visit Amazon</a></p>
            <img src="images/amazon.jpeg" alt="Amazon Product Listing Screenshot">
            <p>Amazon organizes product details, including the product title, price, and product options (e.g., size, color), in close proximity. By grouping these elements together, Amazon provides users with a clear and organized presentation of essential product information. Shoppers can quickly access details they need to make informed purchase decisions without unnecessary distractions.</p>

            <h2>PARC: Alignment</h2>
            <p><strong>PARC: Alignment</strong> involves organizing elements along a common axis to create a sense of order and structure.</p>
            <p>Example: Apple's Product Page</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Visit Apple</a></p>
            <img src="images/apple.jpeg" alt="Apple Product Page Screenshot">
            <p>Apple's product page showcases aligned product images, titles, and descriptions in a clean and organized manner, creating a visually pleasing and user-friendly browsing experience.</p>
